'''

    room.append(teacher)
print(rooms)
print('there are {} people in room1, {} people in room2 and {} people in room3'.format(len(rooms[0]),len(rooms[1]),len(rooms[2])))

# 带下标我们一般都使用while语句实现，但for...in语句也可以实现下标的提取，需要使用enumerate函数

for i, room in enumerate(rooms):

    for teacher in room:
        print(teacher,end='\t')
    print()
